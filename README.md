[Aptomi](http://aptomi.io) simplifies roll-out, operation and control of complex container-based applications. Instead of dealing with
thousands of individual containers, Dev and Ops can now talk services. Service-based approach enables Dev to move
faster, while providing control and insights/contextual visibility to Ops.

It is particularly useful in environments with multiple teams, clouds and data centers, where intent-based management
plays an important role in running large application infrastructure. Aptomiâ€™s current focus is Kubernetes, but it's
designed to work with any container runtime and container orchestration technologies.

## Features & Benefits
- **Easy way to deploy and manage complex applications**
  - See [example](examples/03-twitter-analytics/diagram.png) of a multi-service application based entirely on containers
- **Run on top of any container platform**
  - k8s, OpenShift (with support coming for AWS ECS, GKE, Docker Datacenter, Mesos)
- **Friendly for Dev and Ops**
  - Keep using your existing application templates (Helm, k8s YAMLs, ksonnet, Ansible, etc)
  - Speak services, not containers. Collaborate between orgs and rely on services published by other teams
  - Easy changes to the running code -- seconds to propagate updated parameters, relocate the whole stack to another cluster, restrict access, etc
- **Continuous state enforcement**
  - Desired state of all services is rendered as a system and continuously validated/enforced 
  - Built-in service discovery ensures all dependencies always are up to date    
- **Lazy allocation of resources**
  - Containers are running only when needed (i.e. when someone declared an intent to consume the corresponding service)
- **Flexible rule engine. *See examples of user-defined rules:***
  - *Production Instances* get deployed to *us-west*, *Staging Instances* get deployed to *us-west*
  - *Web* and *Mobile* teams always share the same *small* flavor of *Analytics* service in *Staging*, while 
    *Healthcare* team gets a dedicated *high-performance* instance of the same service
  - *Development* teams can never deploy to *Production*
  - *Personal* development instances of *MyApp* can only be running *from 7am to 11pm* and should be terminated overnight 
    for all developers
- **Insights & Contextual visibility**
  - UI to understand what services are running, why they were instantiated, visualize dependencies and impact of changes. No
    need to deal with thousands of individual containers

## Where Aptomi is located in the stack
Aptomi sits in between CI/CD and container orchestration. Being in deployment path for applications, it can apply
higher-level policy rules (see examples above) and configure the underlying infrastructure components accordingly.

## User Guide

### Installation
Aptomi is under active development right now, so the best way to install Aptomi is to build it from source. It's a very
straightforward process and it will ensure you have the latest version from master that likely passes all unit and integration
tests. Follow [Building From Source](#building-from-source) instructions to build the binaries. 

### Getting Started

#### Configuring LDAP
Aptomi needs to be configured with user data source in order to enable UI login and make policy decisions based on users' labels/properties. It's recommended to
start with LDAP, which is also required by Aptomi examples and smoke tests.
1. LDAP Server with sample users is provided in a docker container. To download and start it, run:
    ```
    ./tools/demo-ldap.sh
    ```
2. It's also recommended to download and install [Apache Directory Studio](http://directory.apache.org/studio/) for browsing LDAP. Once installed,
follow these [step-by-step instructions](http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/basic-ug/1.4.2-changing-admin-password.html) to connect to LDAP and browse it

#### Creating k8s Clusters
You need to have access to k8s cluster in order to deploy services from the provided examples. Two k8s clusters will enable you to
take full advantage of Aptomi policy engine and use cluster-based rules.
1. If you don't have k8s clusters set up, follow [these instructions](examples/README.md) and run the provided script to create them in Google Cloud.
    ```
    ./tools/demo-gke.sh up
    ```

#### Starting Aptomi
1. Assuming Aptomi binaries are built already, create config for the server and start it:
    ```
    sudo cp examples/config/server.yaml /etc/aptomi/config.yaml
    aptomi server
    ```

2. Create config for the client and make sure it can connect to the server:
    ```
    mkdir ~/.aptomi
    cp examples/config/client.yaml ~/.aptomi/config.yaml
    aptomictl -u Sam policy show
    ```
    You should be able to see:
    ```
    &{{policy} {1 2017-11-19 00:00:05.613151 -0800 PST aptomi} map[]}
    ```
    

#### Running Examples
Once Aptomi is up and running and k8s clusters are set up, you can get started by running the following examples:

## Dev Guide

### Building From Source
In order to build Aptomi from source you will need Go (the latest 1.9.x) and a couple of external dependencies:
* docker - to run Aptomi in container, as well as to run sample LDAP server with user data
* glide - all Go dependencies for Aptomi are managed via [Glide](https://glide.sh/)
* npm - to build UI, as well as automatically generate table of contents in README.md 
* telnet - for the script which runs smoke tests

Check out Aptomi source code from the repo:
```
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/Aptomi
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Aptomi
git clone git@github.com:Aptomi/aptomi.git
```

If you are on macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Docker For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), then run: 
```
brew install go glide docker npm telnet
```

Install Helm, Kubectl clients:
```
./tools/install-clients.sh
```

In order to build Aptomi, you must first tell Glide to fetch all of its dependencies. It will read the list of
dependencies defined in `glide.lock` and fetch them into a local "vendor" folder. After that, you must run Go to
build and install the binaries. There are convenient Makefile targets for both, run them:
```
make vendor 
make install
```
