[Aptomi](http://aptomi.io) simplifies roll-out, operation and control of complex container-based applications. Instead of dealing with
thousands of individual containers, Dev and Ops can now talk services. Service-based approach enables Dev to move
faster, while providing control and insights/contextual visibility to Ops.

It is particularly useful in environments with multiple teams, clouds and data centers, where intent-based management
plays an important role in running large application infrastructure. Aptomiâ€™s current focus is Kubernetes, but it's
designed to work with any container runtime and container orchestration technologies.

## Features & Benefits
- **Easy way to deploy and manage complex applications**
  - See [example](examples/03-twitter-analytics/diagram.png) of a multi-service application based entirely on containers
- **Run on top of any container platform**
  - k8s, OpenShift (with support coming for AWS ECS, GKE, Docker Datacenter, Mesos)
- **Friendly for Dev and Ops**
  - Keep using your existing application templates (Helm, k8s YAMLs, ksonnet, Ansible, etc)
  - Speak services, not containers. Collaborate between orgs and rely on services published by other teams
  - Easy changes to the running code -- seconds to propagate updated parameters, relocate the whole stack to another cluster, restrict access, etc
- **Continuous state enforcement**
  - Desired state of all services is rendered as a system and continuously validated/enforced 
  - Built-in service discovery ensures all dependencies always are up to date    
- **Lazy allocation of resources**
  - Containers are running only when needed (i.e. when someone declared an intent to consume the corresponding service)
- **Flexible rule engine. *See examples of user-defined rules:***
  - *Production Instances* get deployed to *us-west*, *Staging Instances* get deployed to *us-west*
  - *Web* and *Mobile* teams always share the same *small* flavor of *Analytics* service in *Staging*, while 
    *Healthcare* team gets a dedicated *high-performance* instance of the same service
  - *Development* teams can never deploy to *Production*
  - *Personal* development instances of *MyApp* can only be running *from 7am to 11pm* and should be terminated overnight 
    for all developers
- **Insights & Contextual visibility**
  - Understand what services are running, why they were instantiated, visualize dependencies and impact of changes. No
    need to deal with thousands of individual containers
    
## Where Aptomi is located in the stack
Aptomi sits in between CI/CD and container orchestration. Being in deployment path for applications, it can apply
higher-level policy rules (see examples above) and configure the underlying infrastructure components accordingly.

## User Guide

### Installation
TODO: "go get", script, docker container? it needs to have clients, etc

### Configuring LDAP
Aptomi needs to be configured with user data source in order to retrieve their labels/properties. It's recommended to
start with LDAP, which is also required by Aptomi examples and smoke tests.
1. LDAP Server with sample users is provided in a docker container. It's very easy to build and run it, just follow the instructions in [ldap-docker](tools/ldap-docker)
2. It's also recommended to download and install [Apache Directory Studio](http://directory.apache.org/studio/) for browsing LDAP. Once installed, follow these [step-by-step instructions](http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/basic-ug/1.4.2-changing-admin-password.html) to connect

### Getting Started & Examples
Once Aptomi is installed, you can get started by running the following examples:

Example    | Description  | Diagram
-----------|--------------|--------------
[examples/01](examples/01) | Description of Example 1 | [Diagram for example #1](examples/01/diagram.png)  
[examples/02](examples/02) | Description of Example 2 | [Diagram for example #2](examples/02/diagram.png)
[examples/03-twitter-analytics](examples/03-twitter-analytics) | Twitter Analytics Application, 2 k8s clusters | [Diagram for example #3](examples/03-twitter-analytics/diagram.png)

## Dev Guide

### Building From Source
Building Aptomi from source and running integration tests is a very straightforward process. All you need is Go (ideally 1.9.1) and a couple of external packages:
* telnet - for the script which runs smoke tests
* docker - to run provided LDAP server with sample user data
* npm - to automatically generate TOC in README.md 

Check out Aptomi source code from the repo:
```
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/Aptomi
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Aptomi
git clone git@github.com:Aptomi/aptomi.git
```

If you are on macOS, install brew, install [Docker For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and run: 
```
brew install telnet docker npm
```

Install Helm, Istio, Kubectl clients:
```
./tools/install-clients.sh
```

All Go dependencies are managed using [Glide](https://glide.sh/). The following command will fetch all dependencies defined in `glide.lock` and put them into "vendor" folder:
```
make vendor 
```

To build the binary:
```
make 
```

### Tests & Code Validation

Command    | Action          | LDAP Required
-----------|-----------------|--------------
```make test```    | Unit tests | No
```make alltest``` | Integration + Unit tests | Yes
```make smoke```   | Smoke tests + Integration + Unit tests | Yes
```make profile-engine```   | Profile engine for CPU usage | No
```make coverage```   | Calculate code coverage by unit tests | No
```make coverage-full```   | Calculate code coverage by unit & integration tests | Yes

Command     | Action          | Description
------------|-----------------|--------------
```make fmt```  | Re-format code | Re-formats all code according to Go standards
```make lint``` | Examine code | Run linters to examine Go source code and reports suspicious constructs

### How to contribute
Report a bug. Send us a pull request.

List of areas where we could use help:
- Feedback from Dev & Ops teams on service & rule definitions
- Adding support for additional cloud providers (AWS ECS, GKE, Docker Datacenter, Mesos)
- Also, see [Feature Backlog](https://github.com/Aptomi/aptomi/milestone/11)

### Roadmap
We will soon publish the list of items for Q4 2017 and Q1 2018. In the meantime,
[Feature Backlog](https://github.com/Aptomi/aptomi/milestone/11) is a good place to look at the roadmap items
which are being considered.
