// todo separate index types and implement only needed
//	 	like
//      * first / last with field value (for getting last version or first / last revision for specific status or policy version)
//      * list with field value (for getting all revisions for specific policy)
// current name -> reference
// no namespace in default object, only in policy objects
// ... -> key (ns/name or ns or "system" for revision/policy/etc.)
// use binary.LittleEndian.PutUint64 to form bolt keys (optimization)
// no need for Deleted interface, just have this field in policy objects and change it with saving it by in place update
// create automatic index that stores last version of the versioned object aka type=last
// get should use index to get last version (if versioned)
// finding & setting new generation should be in the same tx with actual update
