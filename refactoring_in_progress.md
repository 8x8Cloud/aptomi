What:
* introducing universal objects
* dealing with context inheritance (== contexts not tied to services)

Items to complete:
- add support for namespaces
- remove enabled flag
- get rid of dependency ID
- get rid of all previous loading code
- get rid of revision.yaml
- inheritance / make sure we are looking for contexts in the right namespace
